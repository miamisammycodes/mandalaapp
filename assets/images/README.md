## Required Images

Please add the following images to this directory:

### Home Screen
- **logo.png** - The main mandala image with the four colored sections ✓ (Added)
  - Should be a square image (1:1 aspect ratio)
  - Recommended minimum size: 1000x1000 pixels
  - Format: PNG with transparency (if applicable)

### Education Content Screens

These images will be displayed on the education content pages:

- **survival_content.png** - Image for "Survival and Development" section
- **non_discrimination_content.png** - Image for "Non Discrimination" section
- **best_interest_content.png** - Image for "Best Interest of the Child" section (e.g., happy children jumping)
- **respect_views_content.png** - Image for "Respect Views of the Child" section

## Image Guidelines

- **Format:** PNG or JPG
- **Size:** Optimize for mobile (each image should be < 500KB if possible)
- **Resolution:** Use 2x or 3x resolution for crisp display on all devices
- **Naming:** Use lowercase with underscores (snake_case)

## Notes

- The mandala image is the most important - the app won't display properly without it
- Content images are optional - the app will show placeholders if they're missing
- Make sure the mandala trapezoid sections (colored areas) match the clipper coordinates defined in the code
